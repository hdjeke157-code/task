    <h2>my favorite topic: the ocean</h2>
    <p>
        the ocean is a truly <b>vast</b> and <i>mysterious</i> place. it covers over <u>70% of the earth is surface</u> and is home to millions of species,  many of which are yet to be discovered. i find the concept of the deep sea incredibly intriguing, from the bioluminescent creatures to the extreme pressures that define the environment. my favorite fact about the ocean is about the mariana trench, which is the<sub>deepest</sub>known point. the pressure there is over 1.000 times the atmospheric pressure at sea level. the ocean is influence on the earth is climate is also <sup>immense</sup>.
